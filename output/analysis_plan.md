Here is the Data Analysis Plan:

‚ùì **1. What is the distribution of orders across different Platforms?**
*   Calculate the count of orders for each unique value in the `Platform` column. Display the results using `tabulate`.
*   *Interpretation:* This shows the popularity or market share of each delivery platform (Jiomart, Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart) within this dataset.

‚ùì **2. What are the most frequently ordered Product Categories?**
*   Calculate the count of orders for each `Product Category`. Display the top 10 results using `tabulate`.
*   *Interpretation:* This identifies the product categories that are most in demand among customers.

‚ùì **3. How are Service Ratings distributed?**
*   Calculate the count of orders for each `Service Rating` (1 to 5). Display the results using `tabulate`.
*   *Interpretation:* This gives an overview of general customer satisfaction. Are most customers happy (ratings 4-5), unhappy (ratings 1-2), or neutral (rating 3)?

üí° **4. What is the average Order Value (INR) per Platform?**
*   Group the data by `Platform` and calculate the mean of `Order Value (INR)` for each platform. Display the results using `tabulate`.
*   *Interpretation:* This helps understand if customers tend to place higher or lower value orders on specific platforms.

üí° **5. What is the average Delivery Time (Minutes) per Platform?**
*   Group the data by `Platform` and calculate the mean of `Delivery Time (Minutes)` for each platform. Display the results using `tabulate`.
*   *Interpretation:* This compares the average delivery speed across different platforms, indicating potential operational efficiency differences.

üí° **6. What is the average Service Rating per Platform?**
*   Group the data by `Platform` and calculate the mean of `Service Rating` for each platform. Display the results using `tabulate`.
*   *Interpretation:* This indicates which platforms generally receive better customer satisfaction scores.

üìà **7. How does the average Order Value (INR) vary by Product Category?**
*   Group the data by `Product Category` and calculate the mean of `Order Value (INR)`. Display the results sorted by average order value (descending) using `tabulate`.
*   *Interpretation:* This reveals which product categories typically involve higher spending per order.

üìà **8. Is there a relationship between Service Rating and average Delivery Time?**
*   Group the data by `Service Rating` and calculate the mean of `Delivery Time (Minutes)` for each rating. Display the results using `tabulate`.
*   *Interpretation:* This explores if lower ratings are associated with longer delivery times, or if higher ratings correlate with faster deliveries.

‚ùì **9. What is the most common Customer Feedback text for each Service Rating score?**
*   Group the data by `Service Rating` and find the most frequent `Customer Feedback` text within each group. Display the results using `tabulate`.
*   *Interpretation:* This provides qualitative insight into *why* customers give certain ratings, linking specific feedback phrases to satisfaction levels.

üìà **10. Consolidated Platform Performance Metrics**
*   Group the data by `Platform` and calculate the average `Order Value (INR)`, average `Delivery Time (Minutes)`, and average `Service Rating` simultaneously. Display the results using `tabulate`.
*   *Interpretation:* This gives a multi-dimensional view of each platform's performance across key metrics (value, speed, satisfaction) for easy comparison.
