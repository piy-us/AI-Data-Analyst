Okay, here is the detailed data cleaning plan based on the provided summary.

**Data Cleaning Plan**

ðŸ§¹ **1. Datatype Conversion**
*   `Order Date & Time`: Currently `object`. Contains time strings (e.g., `19:29.5`).
    *   **Action:** Investigate the exact format consistency (e.g., presence of `.5`). If consistent or can be standardized, consider converting to a `timedelta` type or extracting numerical features like `Order_Minute`, `Order_Second` if time-of-day analysis is needed. If format is too inconsistent or only used as a category, leave as `object` after cleaning (Step 5). For this plan, assume conversion isn't strictly necessary unless time-based analysis is key, focus on string consistency first (See Step 5).
*   `Delivery Delay`: Currently `object` with values 'Yes'/'No'.
    *   **Action:** Convert to Boolean (`True`/`False`) or Integer (`1`/`0`). (Rationale: Easier for analysis and modeling).
*   `Refund Requested`: Currently `object` with values 'Yes'/'No'.
    *   **Action:** Convert to Boolean (`True`/`False`) or Integer (`1`/`0`). (Rationale: Easier for analysis and modeling).

âœ¨ **2. Handle Missing Values**
*   Based on the summary (`Missing Values Per Column`), there are **zero missing values** reported across all columns.
    *   **Action:** No action required for missing value imputation.

ðŸ§¹ **3. Handle Duplicate Rows**
*   Based on the summary (`Duplicate Rows Count`), there are **zero duplicate rows**.
    *   **Action:** No action required for duplicate row removal.

âœ¨ **4. Handle Outliers**
*   `Delivery Time (Minutes)`: 475 outliers detected. Max value is 76 minutes.
    *   **Action:** **No outlier treatment needed** at this stage. (Rationale: The maximum value of 76 minutes, while potentially high, is plausible for delivery times and may represent valid data points reflecting specific circumstances. Removal could bias the analysis. Investigate specific cases if analysis results seem skewed).
*   `Order Value (INR)`: 4360 outliers detected. Max value is 2000 INR.
    *   **Action:** **No outlier treatment needed** at this stage. (Rationale: A maximum order value of 2000 INR is reasonable. These likely represent legitimate large orders. Removal could distort understanding of purchasing behavior).
*   `Service Rating`: 0 outliers detected.
    *   **Action:** No action required.

ðŸ§¹ **5. Improve Consistency & Formatting**
*   **General:** Apply trim whitespace to all `object` type columns (`Order ID`, `Customer ID`, `Platform`, `Order Date & Time`, `Product Category`, `Customer Feedback`, `Delivery Delay` [before conversion], `Refund Requested` [before conversion]) to remove leading/trailing spaces.
*   `Order Date & Time`: Contains time strings like `19:29.5`, `54:29.5`. 60 unique values reported.
    *   **Action:** Standardize the format. Ensure all entries follow a consistent pattern (e.g., `MM:SS.f` or `MM:SS`). Check if the `.5` indicates half-seconds or is an artifact; clarify and make uniform.
*   `Platform`: Values (`JioMart`, `Blinkit`, `Swiggy Instamart`) appear consistent.
    *   **Action:** Verify case consistency (e.g., ensure no `jiomart` vs `JioMart`). Apply title case or lower case for uniformity if needed, though current values look good.
*   `Product Category`: Values (`Fruits & Vegetables`, `Dairy`, etc.) appear consistent.
    *   **Action:** Verify case and spelling consistency. Apply standardization if minor variations are found upon closer inspection.
*   `Customer Feedback`: 13 unique values reported.
    *   **Action:** Review the 13 unique feedback strings. Check for variations that mean the same thing (e.g., "great service!" vs "Great service"). Consolidate if necessary and appropriate. Standardize case.
*   `Delivery Delay` & `Refund Requested`: Values ('Yes', 'No') appear consistent.
    *   **Action:** Ensure only 'Yes' and 'No' exist before converting to boolean/integer in Step 1.

âœ¨ **6. Minimal Feature Engineering**
*   `Order Date & Time`: If detailed time-based analysis is required *after* cleaning/standardization in Step 5:
    *   **Action:** Consider extracting numerical components like `Order_Minute` and `Order_Second` from the standardized `Order Date & Time` string. (Rationale: Allows quantitative analysis of order timing). *Note: This depends on the analysis goals.*
*   No other obvious simple feature combinations (like Full Name) are apparent from the column names provided.

**Summary of Output:**
The final dataset saved to `'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/data_processed.csv'` will have corrected data types for boolean-like columns, standardized string formats, and verified consistency, ready for analysis. No rows will be dropped due to missing values or duplicates based on the initial summary. Outliers will be retained for initial analysis.
