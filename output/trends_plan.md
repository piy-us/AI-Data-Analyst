Okay, here is a plan outlining up to 6 potential key trends or patterns for further investigation using Plotly, based on the provided data summary and avoiding the already planned visualizations.

---

üîç **1. Delivery Time Variation by Product Category**
*   **Rationale:** While overall delivery time distribution is planned (Plot 3), this explores if specific product categories inherently take longer or shorter to deliver, potentially due to sourcing, packing complexity, or warehouse location.
*   **Analysis/Plot Type:** Box plot using `plotly.express.box`. X-axis: `Product Category`, Y-axis: `Delivery Time (Minutes)`.
*   **Title:** 'Delivery Time Distribution Across Product Categories'
*   **Filename:** `trend1_delivery_time_by_category.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/trend_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Compare the boxes (median, spread) and whiskers across categories. Identify categories with significantly longer/shorter or more variable delivery times. Hover for specific stats (Q1, Median, Q3)."

‚ú® **2. Service Rating Variation by Platform**
*   **Rationale:** The overall rating distribution is planned (Plot 5), but this investigates if customer satisfaction (via Service Rating) differs significantly between the delivery platforms (Jiomart, Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart).
*   **Analysis/Plot Type:** Box plot using `plotly.express.box`. X-axis: `Platform`, Y-axis: `Service Rating`.
*   **Title:** 'Service Rating Distribution Across Platforms'
*   **Filename:** `trend2_rating_by_platform.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/trend_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Compare the median rating and rating spread (box length) for each platform. Identify platforms with consistently higher/lower or more varied customer ratings. Hover for details."

üß≠ **3. Relationship Between Delivery Time and Service Rating**
*   **Rationale:** Explores the direct link between delivery speed and customer satisfaction. Do longer delivery times consistently lead to lower ratings?
*   **Analysis/Plot Type:** Box plot using `plotly.express.box`. X-axis: `Service Rating` (treated as categorical), Y-axis: `Delivery Time (Minutes)`.
*   **Title:** 'How Delivery Time Varies with Service Rating'
*   **Filename:** `trend3_delivery_time_by_rating.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/trend_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Observe the distribution of delivery times for each service rating score. Look for trends, e.g., do lower ratings (1, 2) correspond to higher median delivery times or wider spreads? Hover for details."

üîç **4. Order Value Distribution Across Platforms**
*   **Rationale:** While average order value per category is planned (Plot 4), this looks at the *distribution* of spending across different platforms. Do customers tend to place larger or smaller orders on specific platforms?
*   **Analysis/Plot Type:** Box plot or Violin plot using `plotly.express.violin` (violin shows density better). X-axis: `Platform`, Y-axis: `Order Value (INR)`.
*   **Title:** 'Order Value Distribution Across Platforms'
*   **Filename:** `trend4_order_value_by_platform.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/trend_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Compare the shape (violin) or box statistics across platforms. Identify platforms with higher median order values, wider spending ranges, or different value concentrations (density)."

‚ú® **5. Interaction between Platform and Product Category on Order Value**
*   **Rationale:** Extends planned plot 4 (Avg Order Value by Category) by adding the `Platform` dimension. Do average order values for the *same* product category differ depending on the platform used?
*   **Analysis/Plot Type:** Grouped Bar chart using `plotly.express.bar`. X-axis: `Product Category`, Y-axis: `Order Value (INR)` (aggregated by mean), Color/Facet: `Platform`.
*   **Title:** 'Average Order Value by Category and Platform'
*   **Filename:** `trend5_avg_value_category_platform.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/trend_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Within each product category, compare the heights of the bars representing different platforms. Identify categories where average spending significantly differs based on the platform chosen. Hover for specific values."

üß≠ **6. Exploring High/Low Value Order Characteristics**
*   **Rationale:** Planned plot 6 shows Order Value vs Delivery Time. This adds `Service Rating` as a third dimension to see if high/low value orders have different satisfaction levels, potentially independent of delivery time.
*   **Analysis/Plot Type:** Scatter plot using `plotly.express.scatter`. X-axis: `Delivery Time (Minutes)`, Y-axis: `Order Value (INR)`, Color: `Service Rating`.
*   **Title:** 'Order Value vs. Delivery Time, Colored by Service Rating'
*   **Filename:** `trend6_value_time_rating_scatter.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/trend_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Observe the distribution of colors (ratings) across the plot. Are high-value orders (top) predominantly associated with high/low ratings? Are low-value orders (bottom) different? Is there a pattern related to delivery time (left/right)? Hover over points for details."
