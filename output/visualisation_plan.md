Here is the visualization blueprint:

ðŸ“ˆ **1. Distribution of Order Value (INR)**
*   **Plot Type:** Histogram using `plotly.express.histogram`.
*   **Column:** `Order Value (INR)`.
*   **Goal:** Understand the frequency distribution of order amounts.
*   **Title:** 'Distribution of Order Value (INR)'
*   **Filename:** `plot1_order_value_distribution.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/saved_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Hover over bars to see the count of orders within specific value ranges. Observe the shape to understand common order values and skewness."

ðŸ“Š **2. Order Count per Platform**
*   **Plot Type:** Bar chart using `plotly.express.bar`.
*   **Column:** `Platform` (Count aggregation).
*   **Goal:** Compare the volume of orders across different delivery platforms.
*   **Title:** 'Total Number of Orders per Platform'
*   **Filename:** `plot2_platform_orders.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/saved_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Compare bar heights to identify the most popular platform(s). Hover over bars for exact order counts per platform."

ðŸ“‰ **3. Distribution of Delivery Time**
*   **Plot Type:** Box plot using `plotly.express.box`.
*   **Column:** `Delivery Time (Minutes)`.
*   **Goal:** Visualize the spread, central tendency, and outliers of delivery times.
*   **Title:** 'Distribution of Delivery Time (Minutes)'
*   **Filename:** `plot3_delivery_time_distribution.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/saved_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Observe the median (line inside the box), interquartile range (box length), and potential outliers (points beyond whiskers). Hover over the box for Q1, Median, Q3 values."

ðŸ“Š **4. Average Order Value by Product Category**
*   **Plot Type:** Bar chart using `plotly.express.bar`.
*   **Columns:** `Product Category` (x-axis), `Order Value (INR)` (y-axis, aggregated by mean).
*   **Goal:** Identify which product categories tend to have higher average spending per order.
*   **Title:** 'Average Order Value (INR) by Product Category'
*   **Filename:** `plot4_avg_value_per_category.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/saved_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Compare bar heights to see which categories have the highest/lowest average order value. Hover over bars for specific average values."

ðŸ“Š **5. Distribution of Service Ratings**
*   **Plot Type:** Bar chart using `plotly.express.histogram` (or `bar` on value counts).
*   **Column:** `Service Rating`.
*   **Goal:** Understand customer satisfaction levels based on ratings frequency.
*   **Title:** 'Distribution of Service Ratings (1-5)'
*   **Filename:** `plot5_service_rating_distribution.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/saved_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Observe the frequency of each rating score (1 to 5). Identify the most and least common ratings provided by customers. Hover for counts."

ðŸ“ˆ **6. Order Value vs. Delivery Time**
*   **Plot Type:** Scatter plot using `plotly.express.scatter`.
*   **Columns:** `Delivery Time (Minutes)` (x-axis), `Order Value (INR)` (y-axis).
*   **Goal:** Explore the potential relationship between how long delivery takes and how much was spent.
*   **Title:** 'Order Value (INR) vs. Delivery Time (Minutes)'
*   **Filename:** `plot6_value_vs_delivery_time.html` in 'D:/AI Data Analysis/output/saved_plots/'.
*   **Interpretation Guidance (On Plot):** "Look for any trend or pattern between delivery time and order value. Does one increase as the other increases/decreases? Hover over points to see individual order details. Note the density of points in different areas."
